* General Info 
  The following application is a content management tool meant to manage the contents of a website.
  With this application it's possible to manage an entire blog section, project section and much more. 
  I would also like to point out that I made this application simple because I needed it 
  for my personal website which is currently using it.
* Technologies
The project was made using:
- Java 11
- Maven 3.6.3
- Spring Framework 
  - Spring Boot 2.3.6
  - Spring Security 
  - Spring JPA
- JUnit 4
- Apache derby
- Jasper

* Launch
In order to run the application you will be required to have Maven and Java 11 installed.

1. Open your terminal and compile the application by typing "mvn clean package".
2. If the message that maven provides at the end is "BUILD SUCCESS" then
you can proceed to run the application by typing "java -jar target/webAdminTool.war".
3. Ones the application is up and running open your favorite browser and type "localhost:8080".
4. Finally login by typing "user" for the username and "password" for the password.
5. To turn off the application select the terminal running the application and press CTRL + C.   

** Final words
After having to manually manage my own websites content I ended up doing what a developer does best,
being lazy, so I created this webapp. This particular version is intended for demo purposes, which is 
why the project has primarily a lot of frontend compontents taken from a bootstrap 4 template.  

Please feel free to provide constructive feedback!
